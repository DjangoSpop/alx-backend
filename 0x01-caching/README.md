# Web Site Caching with Python

This repository provides a Python implementation of web site caching, which can help improve the performance and reduce the load on your web server. Caching involves storing the results of expensive operations, such as database queries or API calls, so that they can be quickly retrieved and served to subsequent requests.

## Features

- **Page caching**: Caches the entire HTML response of a web page.
- **Fragment caching**: Caches specific parts of a web page, such as a sidebar or a frequently updated section.
- **Cache expiration**: Implements cache expiration strategies to ensure that stale data is not served to users.
- **Cache invalidation**: Provides mechanisms to invalidate the cache when the underlying data changes.

## Getting Started

To get started with web site caching using Python, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure the caching settings in the `config.py` file.
4. Integrate the caching logic into your web application.
5. Test and monitor the performance improvements.

## Usage

To use the web site caching library, follow the usage instructions provided in the [documentation](https://link-to-documentation).
